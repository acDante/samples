## Description
 Server side controller program of the Sample project to move avator with KinectV2, as C++ project.
 This is a sample project to move avator in SIGVerse with KinectV2.  
 When you move in front of KinectV2 sensor, an avator in the SIGVerse
 moves along with your movement. 

## Demo

## VS. 

## Requirement

 You can download from below:  
 SIGViewer-2.2.0 or later , SIGVerse-2.2.0 or later

## Usage
 1. start SIGServer on Linux. SIGVerse must be SIGVerse-2.2.0 or later.
   $ cd /KinectV2  
   $ sigserver.sh -w ./kinectWorld.xml(filename) -p 9000(port number)  
 3. start SIGViewer on Windows8 or later.
 4. push start button on SIGViewer to start simulation.
 5. edit KinectV2_2013.bat, set your IP adress and port number of Linux machine
 6. execute KinectV2_2013.bat.
 7. move your body in front of KinectV2 sensor.
